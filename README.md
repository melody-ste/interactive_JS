## Interactive page with JavaScript

### Description

This project contains an HTML file (`exo_events.html`) and an associated JavaScript file (`script.js`).  
It demonstrates various DOM manipulation techniques and interactive functionalities using vanilla JavaScript.

---
### How to use

- Open the `exo_events.html` file in your browser.
- Interact with the elements on the page to see the JavaScript events in action.

---
#### Functionality 1: Footer click logging
- Clicking the footer logs `"clique"` in the console.
- Each additional click logs `"clic numÃ©ro X"` where X increases with every click.

#### Functionality 2: Toggle navbar
- Clicking the hamburger menu button toggles the visibility of the navbar (`collapse` class).

#### Functionality 3: Edit button (first card turns red)
- Clicking the "Edit" button on the first card changes the text color to red.

#### Functionality 4: Toggle green text (second card)
- Clicking the "Edit" button on the second card toggles its text color between green and default.

#### ðŸ§ª Functionality 5: Disable Bootstrap
- Double-clicking the navbar disables or re-enables the Bootstrap CSS by toggling the `<link>` tag.

#### Functionality 6: View buttons interaction
- Hovering over a card's "View" button hides the text and shrinks the image.
- Moving the mouse away resets the text and image size.

#### Functionality 7: Rotate cards backward
- Clicking the gray button moves the **last card** to the **beginning** of the list.

#### Functionality 8: Rotate cards forward
- Clicking the blue button moves the **first card** to the **end** of the list.
- The default button behavior (link navigation) is prevented.
